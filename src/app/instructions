make me a login api for student app login.....so students would enter the data and if the admin data base has the data the student would gain access......simple...following data user needs to put 
{
    "name": "abbas",
    "rollNo": "11223344",
    "fatherName": "Ahmed Raza",
    "email": "zaheerstudioz@gmail.com",
    "phone": "03027251287",
    "deptId": "-OjfI3YDSO1sPysLbQwr",
    "secId": "-OjfILkkMe6KVuepY7YV"
}

in the student app this is the form that user fills to proceed..... i only need you to make me an api so i can implement it in the student user app
